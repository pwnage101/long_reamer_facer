Introduction
============

The 2D LibreCAD file ``long_reamer_facer.dxf`` contains a static design for an
extra long reamer/facer rod attachment for use with cargo bike head tubes or
any other long head tube.  It is intended to work with the Park Tool HTR-1(B)
head tube reamer/facer set.

The document ``long_reamer_facer.pdf`` contains the final drawing, print this
for your reference at the machine shop.

Here is a preview of the current design:

This is essentially a copy of the Park Tool HTR-1 shaft with a slight
modification (longer ACME threaded section).  Therefore, I can't claim any
ownership of the design, nor anybody else unaffiliated with Park Tool.
